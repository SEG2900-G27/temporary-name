# Second Chance Servings (SCS)


Our product consists of a service to reduce food waste from restaurants and other food markets. This service involves drivers to pick up food and supplies that are still ready to eat for those in need. Our goal is to not only recycle food but to also reduce famine in our communities. We aim to put in place strict measurements to ensure the safety and quality of our goods. We will offer volunteering as well as full and part time employement opportunities. Our service will be centered around the city of Ottawa and hopefully expand in the near future.
